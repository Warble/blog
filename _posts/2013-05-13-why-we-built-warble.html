<p>We started discussing the idea of Warble after pinpointing the need to know when your business, Website or product was mentioned on Twitter without your specific Twitter handle being mentioned. It’s not that this solution doesn’t exist in some form today, it just didn’t exist in a way that appealed to our lifestyle and usage patterns. You can use a variety of apps like Hootsuite to track just about anything but the problem is you have to be constantly monitoring and checking it. If you have a business that requires real-time interaction then it’s probably inevitable that you will use one of those tools. If you don’t and on top of that are very busy like most people, monitoring an app all day is just not an option. This is where <a href="http://warble.co">Warble</a> comes in.</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://warble.co">Warble</a> you can set up an alert for almost anything using Twitter’s powerful search parameters.</p>

<p>The great thing about this is it took our small idea of wanting to track specific things like your business’ name and opened the door to being able to track anything at all. This could range from topics you’re interested in, to tweets from or to specific accounts and a variety of other things.</p>

<h1>You can use Warble in a variety of ways for business or personal:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Daily digest of news from your favorite online sources</li>
  <li>Use as a customer acquisition tool; tracking who talks to competitors or keywords at large or in a specific area</li>
  <li>Track news in or around your neighborhood with specific hashtags</li>
  <li>Track when your business name or site is mentioned without a Twitter handle</li>
  <li>Get links to news and articles for topics you’re interested in</li>
  <li>Tracking tweets and hashtags in a social media campaign</li>
</ul>

<h1>Warble Makes Email Exciting Again?</h1>

<p>Remember when email was exciting and didn’t feel like work? When you checked your inbox and saw "2 new messages!" Seeing Warble alerts arrive in your inbox has brought a similar feeling back. The undiscovered and unknown a - "what will I find in today’s alerts?" sort of excitement.

<p>The downside in some cases can be too much content to weed through, which makes staying on top of how you setup your alerts important. The more general your searches are the more content you will get and the quality of that content may be hit or miss. For this reason we’ve included a "Preview" button, which will allow you to see your alert results before committing to them.
