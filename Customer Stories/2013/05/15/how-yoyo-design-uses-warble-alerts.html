      <p><a href="http://www.yoyodesign.com/">Yoyo Design</a> is a creative digital agency based just outside of London. They specialize in creating and communicating clear, compelling brand and marketing messages across multiple digital platforms and devices. We asked them a few questions about how they use Warble.</p>

<em>Tell us a little bit about what you do at YoYo Design.</em>
<p>I&#x2019;m Christine Moore and I&#x2019;m a developer at Yoyo. I spend my days building CMS driven, responsive websites using the latest technologies, and coding in .NET to add the technical elements that our clients need for their websites. I am also involved in projects building iPhone and Android apps, email marketing campaigns, SEO and a multitude of other services. I help manage our social media presence and am the person behind the Yoyo Design twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyodesign">@yoyodesign</a></p>

<em>Why did you start using Warble Alerts?</em>
<p>A colleague mentioned it to me and I thought it would be a great way of helping manage our twitter account. When you are tweeting alongside other work duties you can&#x2019;t check your timeline all day so you&#x2019;re bound to miss useful tweets. Using Warble Alerts I get emails with all the tweets that are relevant to me, so at the beginning of each day I review them and pick out anything that I find interesting.</p>


<em>What type of value does Warble offer you?</em>
<p>Warble has definitely helped me save valuable time, whilst allowing me to read more relevant tweets than I was before. Before using Warble Alerts I had to search through everything on my timeline to find anything of interest. Now they are collected for me so I can spend time communicating with people that are more engaged with Yoyo. As the alerts are sent as emails, it means that I can read them wherever I go on my mobile and also save them for future reference if I need to. I particularly like the fact that you can exclude retweets as this prevents the same content appearing twice in an alert.</p>


<em>Can you share some examples of content you would you have missed if it wasn&#x2019;t for Warble?</em>
<p>Warble Alerts includes tweets from people that I don&#x2019;t follow, as well as those I do, so anyone who&#x2019;s tweeting about keywords that I&#x2019;ve chosen are included in the alerts. It&#x2019;s impossible to follow everyone who&#x2019;s tweeting about a particular subject you&#x2019;re interested in, so Warble does this for you. I have found some particularly useful coding tutorials for JavaScript development through my Warble Alerts that I may have otherwise never come across, so this has been massively helpful to me for learning from others via Twitter.</p>


<em>Can you tell us a little bit about the types of alerts you setup?</em>
<p>I have set up Warble Alerts for topics in the industry that I am constantly following, such as &#x2018;responsive design&#x2019;. Through this I find tips, tricks and tutorials as well as interesting news articles that others in the industry have tweeted in my alerts. I have also set up an alert for &#x2018;website Tunbridge Wells OR London&#x2019;, these sorts of alerts are invaluable for keeping an eye out on what&#x2019;s going on in the local area and potentially contacting new clients and partners. As a company we like to stay ahead of the curve, and Warble Alerts definitely helps me to achieve this.</p>

<em>Anything else you&#x2019;d like to add?</em>
<p>Warble Alerts is a great idea, I wish I&#x2019;d thought of it myself! It&#x2019;s useful for anyone managing a social media account for business or for just keeping up with the latest trends.</p>
