<p><a href="http://www.yoyodesign.com/">Yoyo Design</a> is a creative digital agency based just outside of London. They specialize in creating and communicating clear, compelling brand and marketing messages across multiple digital platforms and devices. We asked them a few questions about how they use Warble.</p>

<em>Tell us a little bit about what you do at YoYo Design.</em>
<p>I’m Christine Moore and I’m a developer at Yoyo. I spend my days building CMS driven, responsive websites using the latest technologies, and coding in .NET to add the technical elements that our clients need for their websites. I am also involved in projects building iPhone and Android apps, email marketing campaigns, SEO and a multitude of other services. I help manage our social media presence and am the person behind the Yoyo Design twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyodesign">@yoyodesign</a></p>

<em>Why did you start using Warble Alerts?</em>
<p>A colleague mentioned it to me and I thought it would be a great way of helping manage our twitter account. When you are tweeting alongside other work duties you can’t check your timeline all day so you’re bound to miss useful tweets. Using Warble Alerts I get emails with all the tweets that are relevant to me, so at the beginning of each day I review them and pick out anything that I find interesting.</p>


<em>What type of value does Warble offer you?</em>
<p>Warble has definitely helped me save valuable time, whilst allowing me to read more relevant tweets than I was before. Before using Warble Alerts I had to search through everything on my timeline to find anything of interest. Now they are collected for me so I can spend time communicating with people that are more engaged with Yoyo. As the alerts are sent as emails, it means that I can read them wherever I go on my mobile and also save them for future reference if I need to. I particularly like the fact that you can exclude retweets as this prevents the same content appearing twice in an alert.</p>


<em>Can you share some examples of content you would you have missed if it wasn't for Warble?</em>
<p>Warble Alerts includes tweets from people that I don’t follow, as well as those I do, so anyone who’s tweeting about keywords that I’ve chosen are included in the alerts. It’s impossible to follow everyone who’s tweeting about a particular subject you’re interested in, so Warble does this for you. I have found some particularly useful coding tutorials for JavaScript development through my Warble Alerts that I may have otherwise never come across, so this has been massively helpful to me for learning from others via Twitter.</p>


<em>Can you tell us a little bit about the types of alerts you setup?</em>
<p>I have set up Warble Alerts for topics in the industry that I am constantly following, such as ‘responsive design’. Through this I find tips, tricks and tutorials as well as interesting news articles that others in the industry have tweeted in my alerts. I have also set up an alert for ‘website Tunbridge Wells OR London’, these sorts of alerts are invaluable for keeping an eye out on what’s going on in the local area and potentially contacting new clients and partners. As a company we like to stay ahead of the curve, and Warble Alerts definitely helps me to achieve this.</p>

<em>Anything else you'd like to add?</em>
<p>Warble Alerts is a great idea, I wish I’d thought of it myself! It’s useful for anyone managing a social media account for business or for just keeping up with the latest trends.</p>
