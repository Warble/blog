      <p>Rich and I started building experiments about a year and a half ago. We first built a really easy way to <a href="http://wshoppr.com" target="_blank">save products you’re interested in buying</a> using a Chrome extension. We then built a <a href="http://getwordsmith.co" target="_blank">jQuery plug-in</a> that adds on-demand word definitions to any site. With each experiment we got smarter and quicker at implementing an idea that solved a specific problem in a shorter amount of time.</p>

<p>Like many people who build things online, our goal was to test the idea with people as soon as humanly possible to validate if there was value in what we were building. Since this was our third shot at building something together, our process has become almost formulaic. So far, we have used the same technology stack and framework for each project. We use Bootstrap for the front-end framework and Ruby on Rails for the back-end framework. We use the <a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">Twitter Gem</a> for talking to Twitter.</p>

<h1>Designing the Fine Line</h1>
<p>
There have been moments (when building things) when we’ve spent too much time designing before developing and too little time as well. Finding the right balance and understanding what type of impact design has on the success of the project we’ve found to be really important. As a designer, if you had asked me this question five years ago I would have said "it absolutely needs to look as good as possible." As someone who evolved from designer to maker of things I am more concerned with user feedback and just making it work while focusing on design that looks good but does not add a lot of overhead to the speed of the project. Design in this context is much more about timing and agility. Anytime you have a chance to validate without putting additional time in, that is a great course of action. Design can be applied at anytime but there is no fix for not understanding if value is being delivered.</p>

<p>Building and designing Warble was great because the scope was so small and it required very little effort (in the bigger scheme of things) for it to look great and get it out the door into the real world. That is one of the nice things about <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/43986871442/email-first-startups" target="_blank">“email first startups”</a> and projects. Warble does one thing and it does it well; it allows you to set up daily email alerts using Twitter’s powerful search engine. We weren’t building a social network, or an e-commerce site, we were building something much simpler, which made execution much easier.</p>

<h1>Proof of Concept</h1>
<p>
We started with our proof of concept, we wanted to get the thing working and have a few other people use it in tandem with us. We applied no time towards design for this, rather we jumped straight into the prototype. This is what our homepage looked like:
<img src="/images/how-we-built-warble/Warble_Homepage.png" class="large" />
And this is what setting up a new alert looked like:
<img src="/images/how-we-built-warble/Warble_New_Alert.png" class="large"/>
After validating that we could get the thing working we introduced it to some more users and started getting feedback right away. We quickly understood where there was value and what sorts of things might make it frustrating. We also of course tested it with ourselves and saw many of the same things (praise and complaints) as our users. 

When we had all the pieces working and enough feedback to encourage us to move forward we simply put a prettier face on the app. Our homepage went from what you see above to this: <a href="http://warble.co">http://warble.co</a> and we created a simple yet good looking alerts interface.

</p>

<p>As well as a nice panel for creating new alerts with some simple help text/guidance.

</p>

<p>Our goal was to increase learning through user feedback while putting something out into the world that we were proud to call our own (i.e. something that worked and looked good). We spent zero time obsessing over design details but we’ll certainly do that once we hit some specific milestones with our idea and see more traction. After all, it’s all about traction not good looks.</p>
